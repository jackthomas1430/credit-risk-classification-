# Credit Risk Classfication 

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to create a logistic regression model to predict the credit risk of borrowers and classify loans into two categories:

0: Healthy loans (low risk of default).
1: High-risk loans (greater likelihood of default).

### Dataset 
The data comes from a peer-to-peer lending services, and includes the following details: loan size, interest rates, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt and loan status (the target variable). The model aims to predict whether a loan will be high risk (1) or healthy (0).


### Key Steps:

1. Data Preparation: The dataset (lending_data.csv) was read into a Pandas DataFrame. The target variable (loan_status) was separated from the features, and the data was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

2. Create Logistic Regression Model: A Logistic Regression model was used  to classify loans into the two categotries. The model was fit using the training data (x_train) and (y_train). The predictions for the testing data labels were then saved using the testing feature data (x_test) and the fitted model. Finally, a confusion matrix and classification report were were generated to evauluate the model's performance.  

3. Model Evaluation: A confusion matrix and classification report were were generated to evauluate the model's performance.  

## Results

* Machine Learning Model 1:
   
Accuracy: 99%
Precision for Class 0 (Healthy Loans): 100%
Precision for Class 1 (High-risk Loans): 86%
Recall for Class 0 (Healthy Loans): 99%
Recall for Class 1 (High-risk Loans): 94%
F1-score for Class 0: 100%
F1-score for Class 1: 90%"

## Summary

The Logistic Regression model performed well, with an overall accuracy of 99%. The model was most effective at identifying healthy loans (0), with a perfect precision score of 100% and a recall score of 99%. It also performed well on high-risk loans (1), with a precision of 86% and a recall of 94%.

### Recommendations 

Based on these results, the logistic regression model is recommended for this task. The model predicts healthy loans with a high degree of accuracy, minimizing the risk of incorrectly labeling a healthy loan as high risk. The model also does well in identifying high-risk loans to prevent loan defaults. The precision and recall for high-risk loans show that the model can accurately identify risky borrowers and reduce the likelyhood of missing actual high-risk loans.Ultimately, the model's ability to accurately predict high-risk loans is important for identifying potential defaults, and the high precision for healthy loans ensures that most low-risk loans are correctly classified.
